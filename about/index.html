	<h1 style="color:black;">Academic History</h1>
	<p style=”font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;color:purple;align=center;”>
	I recently graduated from Ohio State in May 2017 with a BS in Atmospheric Science and minor in Environmental Science. During my undergraduate carreer, I conducted undergraduate research in the School of Earth Sciences, was employed through the Office of Research, and worked as a student research assistant at the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center. I was also involved with Meteorology Club	and Womens Glee at Ohio State. </p>

	<h1 style="color:black;">Personal Interests</h1>
	<p style=”font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;color:purple;align=center;”>
	I have recently begun taking cycling classes and am eager to start biking outside once the Ohio weather warms up. I also like running outdoors and hiking. I travel a few times a year for hiking and camping trips with my family and boyfriend. </p>

	<h1 style="color:black;">Future Goals</h1>
	<p style=”font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;color:purple;align=center;”>
	My dream is to work at a scientific government agency. I hope to incorporate both high-level climate research and public education into my job. I enjoy teaching and educating about science in addition to conducting research. </p>
