	<h2 style="color:black;">Academic History</h2>
	<p style=”font-size:10px;font-family:Arial;color:black;align=center;”>
	I recently graduated from Ohio State in May 2017 with a BS in Atmospheric Science and minor in Environmental Science. During my undergraduate career, I conducted research in the School of Earth Sciences, was employed through the Office of Research, and worked as a student research assistant at the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center. I was also involved with Meteorology Club and Womens Glee at Ohio State. </p>

	<h2 style="color:black;">Personal Interests</h2>
	<p style=”font-size:10px;font-family:Arial;color:black;align=center;”>
	I have recently begun taking cycling classes and am eager to start biking outside once the Ohio weather warms up. I also like running outdoors and hiking. I travel a few times a year for hiking and camping trips with my family and boyfriend. </p>

	<h2 style="color:black;">Future Goals</h2>
	<p style=”font-size:10px;font-family:Arial;color:black;align=center;”>
	My ultimate goal is to work in a federal science agency. I hope to incorporate both high-level climate research and public education into my job. I enjoy teaching and educating about science in addition to conducting research. </p>
